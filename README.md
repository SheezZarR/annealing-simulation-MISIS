# Annealing Simulation MISIS

Solution for the backpack problem.

We are given n objects denoted by xi (i = 1, 2,...,n) each with corresponding weight wi. We can imagine
a person carrying a backpack who has access to each of these objects. Unfortunately, this person can only
hold some maximum weight W in his backpack. The problem follows: what is the optimal assortment of
objects such that the person maximizes the value of objects in his pack with the constraint of weight W?
